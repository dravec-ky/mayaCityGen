# mayaCityGen
![thumbnail](https://github.com/dravec-ky/mayaCityGen/blob/main/src/CG_thumbnail.png)

A python script for procedural city generation within Maya.

This python script does 2 main tasks:
1. Procedurally generates a street layout according to the directional constrains placed by the 
user.
2. Generates buildings around the streets using user-defined groups and their responding 
paintable maps to create a varied cityscape.

Before running the script, make sure the insides of the src folder are placed into the scripts folder of your Maya workspace.

Optional files:
CG_thumbnail.png adds a thumbnail to the top of the interface
CG_buildings.fbx makes the script automatically import the base building package into the scene

For any issues with how the program refer to the Manual.pdf
